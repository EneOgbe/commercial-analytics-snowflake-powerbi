# Power BI Dashboard

This folder contains screenshots of the Power BI dashboard built for this
project.

The dashboard is structured across three pages:

1. **Partner ROI Scorecard**  
   High-level view of partner performance, ROI, margin, and costs to support
   commercial decision-making.

2. **Partner Funnel & Risk Quality**  
   Analysis of funded, performing, and defaulted loans to assess funnel health
   and risk concentration by partner channel.

3. **Performance Trends & Monitoring**  
   Ongoing monitoring of margin per loan and default rate trends to identify
   emerging partner performance risks or opportunities.

## Notes
- The Power BI `.pbix` file is not included to avoid sharing credentials or
  embedded connections.
- Screenshots are provided to demonstrate analytical approach, structure, and
  insights rather than tool-specific configuration.
