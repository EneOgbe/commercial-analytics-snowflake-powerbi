# SQL Transformations

This folder contains the SQL used to model and analyse the loan data in
Snowflake.

The SQL focuses on:
- Creating loan-level fact tables
- Deriving partner channels
- Calculating commercial metrics such as revenue, margin, ROI, and default rate
- Building analytical views used by the BI layer

Queries are written for clarity and analytical correctness rather than
production optimisation.
